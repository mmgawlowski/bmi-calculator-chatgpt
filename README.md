# BmiCalculator

This project was created as an attempt to use ChatGPT to create simple applications.
I asked to create a BMI calculator based on Angular. 
I gradually added more elements like:
- CSS styles;
- validation of form fields;
- components from Angular Material;
- simple animations.

Some of the problems that arose I had to solve based on sources other than ChatGPT, which may be due to the use of Angular in a newer version than is known to the free version of ChatGPT.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
